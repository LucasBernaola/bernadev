          Learning something not only requires innate abilities; it is essential
          to be consistent and practice repeatedly until mastering it and
          reaching the goals set. Since I decided to change direction and become
          a developer, I discovered a passion for this craft, and the ability to
          bring ideas to the screen is extraordinary. Thatâ€™s why I dedicate all
          my time to achieving this goal.

          As a self-taught learner, I strive to
          find information from the best possible sources. I understood that
          acquiring the necessary knowledge takes time and that there are no
          shortcuts to gaining valuable experience. I also appreciate the worth
          of knowledge and the importance of advice from experienced
          professionals.

          My focus as a developer is on the frontend, although my
          first professional experience was in backend, which gives me a more
          comprehensive perspective when approaching projects or tasks. I also
          plan to explore software development and artificial intelligence using
          Python.
